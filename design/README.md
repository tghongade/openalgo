# OpenAlgo Design Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the design documentation for OpenAlgo, a broker-agnostic algorithmic trading platform API.

### Purpose

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the OpenAlgo system architecture, core components, design patterns, data flows, and operational considerations. It serves as a guide for developers, architects, and maintainers involved in the development and extension of the platform.

### Overview

OpenAlgo provides a RESTful API interface built with Flask, allowing users and automated systems to:
*   Connect to various stock brokers.
*   Manage trading accounts.
*   Retrieve market data.
*   Define and execute trading strategies.
*   Monitor trading activity and performance.

### Goals

*   **Broker Agnosticism:** Provide a unified API layer abstracting the complexities of different broker APIs.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily integrate new brokers and trading strategies.
*   **Performance:** Ensure efficient handling of API requests and trading operations.
*   **Reliability:** Maintain stable connections and robust error handling.
*   **Usability:** Offer a clear and well-documented API for developers.

### Target Users

*   Algorithmic Traders
*   Developers building custom trading applications
*   Quantitative Analysts
*   Trading Firms

This documentation is structured into modular sections, navigable through the sidebar in GitBook (or by browsing the files directly), covering different aspects of the system.
