## Workflow Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Fetch and preprocess historical data for ML.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create technical indicators and features.
3. **Model Training**: Train ML models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost) to predict trading signals.
4. **Signal Generation**: Use trained models to generate buy/sell signals.
5. **Backtesting**: Evaluate AI signals against historical data.

All files here are independent and do not affect your main production strategy.
